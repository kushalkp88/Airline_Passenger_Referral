# Airline_Passenger_Referral
**Airline Passenger Referral Prediction**

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on developing a machine learning classification model to predict the sentiment or category of airline reviews. The dataset consists of airline reviews labeled with sentiments such as positive, negative, or neutral, along with specific categories like customer service, in-flight experience, etc. The goal is to help airlines analyze customer feedback effectively and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction.

**Project Structure:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, text normalization, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings are used to represent the textual data in a machine-readable format.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Various supervised machine learning classification algorithms are explored, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

4. **Model Evaluation and Optimization:**
   - Models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

5. **Insights and Results:**
   - The final classification model is used to predict the sentiment or category of new, unseen airline reviews. Insights from the model can guide airlines in improving services and customer satisfaction.

**Additional Features:**

- Exception Handling: The code includes robust error handling to handle exceptions gracefully.
- Production Grade Code: The code is structured and documented to ensure readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- Deployment Ready Code: The entire notebook is executable without errors, facilitating seamless deployment.

**Charts and Visualizations:**
- Various charts and visualizations are included to illustrate insights from the data and model performance.
- Each chart is accompanied by an explanation of its relevance to the project goals.

**Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning:**
- Cross-validation techniques are employed to assess model generalization performance.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed using methods like GridSearchCV and Bayesian Optimization to fine-tune model parameters.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Explanation of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score is provided.
- Business impact of each evaluation metric is discussed to highlight the relevance to airline decision-making.

**Conclusion:**
- A summary of exploratory data analysis insights and model performance is provided.
- Recommendations for airlines based on model insights are outlined to improve customer satisfaction and recommendations.
